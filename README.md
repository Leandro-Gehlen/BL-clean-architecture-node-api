## About This Repo  

The main resource of this activity is [**this live**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0gpCCA8ZPs&t=9s) that these brazilian giants devs have made. **Rodrigo Branas** and **Rodrigo Manguinhos**.  

At this repo IÂ´ll be learning how to implement Clean Architecture on a node api project.\
Also, **my main objective isnÂ´t just to know how to do it, but also try to identify what DESIGN PATTERS are being used and which SOLID principle they are implementing to achieve Clean Architecture implamentation.** ðŸ¤“  



##  About Clean Architecture  

["Uncle Bob" BLOG](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)  

"By separating the software into layers, and conforming to **The Dependency Rule**, you will create a system that is intrinsically **testable**, with all the benefits that implies. When any of the external parts of the system become obsolete, like the database, or the web framework, **you can replace** those **obsolete elements with a minimum of fuss**."  

### Characteristics  
+ "The Dependency Rule"
+ Layers & Boundaries
+ Interfaces
+ Abstract Classes
+ Concrete Classes
+ Entities
+ Use Case Layer
+ Domain Layer
+ Infra Layer

## **SOLID Principles**  //  [**Ref - www.freecodecamp.com**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solid-principles-explained-in-plain-english/)

+ **S** =>  The Single Responsibility Principle
+ **O** =>  The Open-Closed Principle
+ **L** =>  The Liskov Substitution Principle
+ **I** =>  The Interface Segregation Principle
+ **D** =>  The Dependency Inversion Principle  

## **The Single Responsibility Principle**  
  
The Single Responsibility Principle states that **a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.**  

**Trick**   


  + **If you ask yourself what your class does and the answer is something AND/OR oneother thing, chances are that the class doesnâ€™t adhere to the Single responsibility principle.**  

Robert C. Martin(Uncle Bob) says:

"Gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different reasons."  
So, itÂ´s nice to check if you are not disrespecting the Single Responsability Principle.

## The Open-Closed Principle  
  
The Open-Closed Principle requires that classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.

Modification means changing the code of an existing class, and extension means adding new functionality.

**Open for Extension:**  
  + adding new functionality(create or change methods ON INSTANCES/OBJECTS)   



**Closed for Modification:**
  +  changing the code of existing class(make changes ON CLASSES) 


The main question is...**how do we do it?!**

There are some **DESIGN PATTERS** that makes it possible to code respecting the **Open-Closed Principle.**

+ **Composite**    
+ **Decorator**  
+ **Proxy**  
+ **Strategy**  



Everything is chained on Clean Architecture.
You will use design patterns to achieve SOLID principles implementation while implements clean architecture.
ThatÂ´s why create a good quality code isnÂ´t easy.You must master all those concepts and learn how to implement them!

I will ve talking about the **Gang of Four** and their **22 Design Patterns** after SOLID principles.  


**IMPORTANT** 

Do not use inherance on your code. ThatÂ´s possible and IÂ´m sure some one told you that itÂ´s a bennefit from OOP.
You can extends the class and create new personalized objects, with polimorphism by changing also their behavier(methods) and implementing new ones.
Ok...**thatÂ´s not you should do from now on!**

>**What should I do?!**  
>
>If you need to extend a class, thatÂ´s fine. But you should not **extend** , but **implement** new classes. That means you should create an abstract class or you should create an interface to be implemented by those concrete classes that you need to create.
>ThatÂ´s important because youÂ´ll be also might be respecting the DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE from soli**D** if those classes are on a more external layer.
>Also, you will not be chaining the concrete classes together, and that independency is the objective.
>
>**Use interfaces insted of extend the parent class. Just create an interface, a contract with the parent class especifications and implements it.Leave the parent concrete class alone.Do not extend it.

## The Liskov Substitution Principle  

The better way to understand this principle is to realise that the children class is an EXTENSION of the parent class. So, it has some boundaries established for the parent.

Parameters +
Return - 

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

This principle is very dangerous, because itÂ´s hard to identify on code.

## The Interface Segregation Principle  

This principle tell us that we should create small interfaces that have only the methods that the concrete class that will be implementing it needs.

If you have a contract with one or more method that the class that will be implementing the interface will never use, you are just creating more complexity and increasing the chances of a software crash.

The inharence allows that a class have just one parent class. But any class can have multiple interfaces.
So, itÂ´s better create many interfaces. One to each one of your classes needs.

##  The Dependency Inversion Principle  

The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.  

This principle is respected by using interfaces. When you use an interface you invert the dependencie and inside layers wonÂ´t know outside layers.



## Gang of Four (GoF) & Design Patterns  

### [Reference - Refactoring.guru](www.refactoring.guru)  

I highly recommend the book of refactoring.guru.  ItÂ´s a book that explains all the 22 design patterns of GoF.

## Creational Patterns  
#### Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.  

+ Factory Method
+ Abstract Factory
+ Builder
+ Prototype
+ Singleton  


## Structural Design Patterns  
#### Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.  

+ Adapter
+ Composite
+ Decorator
+ Proxy
+ Bridge
+ Facade
+ Flyweight




## Behavioral Design Patterns  
#### Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.  

+ Chain of Responsability
+ Command
+ Iterator
+ Mediator
+ Memento
+ Observer
+ State
+ Strategy
+ Template Method
+ Visitor  



# LetÂ´s Start!  
#### From now on, all comments are about [**the youtube live video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0gpCCA8ZPs&t=9s) and the code that was implemented by **Rodrigo** **Manguinho!!**  


+ Coding starts at min 30:00  

## The Setup  

The setup of my project will be the setup that **Manguinho** shows at one other of his videos on youtube.
ItÂ´s a setup for TDD - Test Driven Development , but seems to be the same that he used on the live and also that he uses on his [course](https://rmanguinho.github.io/).So, IÂ´m going to use it too.To watch the videos where he shows how to setup a node project like him, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV1wQ6GFH0A)


## My Own Comments  


### Manguinhos moched the database. The data was added as source code and the requirements of the project was also added as requirements.

### Domain Layer  

+ Entities 
+ usecases

We start by defining our entity. After that , there are 3 ways we can create them with Typescript. By creating a type , an abstract class or an instance.

Maguinhos choose to create a type to represent his entity.
This entity doenÂ´t have any method. No behavior. So a type was the best way to represent it.
If there was any method / behavior from this entity, the best way would be a abstract class.
As manguinho told Rodrigo Branas, type and instance are not the same because they have diferent meanings. A type is an instance of just a javascript object and instances will be implemented by concrete classes.
So, the entity is just a typescript type.


At usecases folder , Manguinho creates his usecase as an interface to be implemented by concrete classes on upper layer


### Application-Layer  

Manguinho creates the application-layer that implements as a concrete class the interface that represents the usecase on the domain-layer.  
But at this layer he is already thinking how data going to came from the infra-layer.
And that is one of the most IMPORTANT points of the video!

## The way data moves between layers.

+ When it cames from outside to inside: 
  + It cames always from a representation of the entity.(new type created so infra-layer donÂ´t know the domain-layer.Outside layer will not know the inside layer)
  +  Manguinhos always create a re-write (representation) of the entity so the external layer doensÂ´t know the inner domain layer.   


+ When it goes from inside to the outside:  
  + The outside layer will be always implementing an instance of the inside layer, and this instance will be injected as the dependency of the inside layer concrete class.(Implementing que Dependency Inversion Principle of SOLID and the Dependency Injection Pattern)

So, what Manguinho does on the service concrete class that implements the usecase interface is to receive as dependency injection an abstraction.That way, the service concrete class will never have a dependency relationship with a concrete class of the more external layer.
But , as the concrete class of the external layer implements that interface that was injected on the inner concrete class, this inner class are able to comunicate with the outer class and receive data from it.But without any kind of dependecy relationship.

Manguinho creates the entity representation on the application layer because the interface that are injected will return that entity representation.That will be the return from the concrete class of the outer layer.But as it should not know the entity, by creating a representation of the entity on the application layer, he unable the outer layer to know the domain layer.Because the outer layer actually dosenÂ´t know that what itÂ´s returning is actually the entity of the domain.

## Data can came from anywhere and with any format  

+  The presentation-layer that implements usecases doesnÂ´t know anything about the infra-layer.So it doesnÂ´t know the data format that cames from infra-layer.Neither if it cames from a database or from an external API request.ThatÂ´s why this data must came from an ADAPTER PATTHERN IMPLEMENTATION.
