## About This Repo  

The main resource of this activity is [**this live**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0gpCCA8ZPs&t=9s) that these brazilian giants devs have made. **Rodrigo Branas** and **Rodrigo Manguinhos**.  

At this repo IÂ´ll be learning how to implement Clean Architecture on a node api project.\
Also, **my main objective isnÂ´t just to know how to do it, but also try to identify what DESIGN PATTERS are being used and which SOLID principle they are implementing to achieve Clean Architecture implamentation.** ðŸ¤“  



##  About Clean Architecture  

["Uncle Bob" BLOG](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)  

"By separating the software into layers, and conforming to **The Dependency Rule**, you will create a system that is intrinsically **testable**, with all the benefits that implies. When any of the external parts of the system become obsolete, like the database, or the web framework, **you can replace** those **obsolete elements with a minimum of fuss**."  

### Characteristics  
+ "The Dependency Rule"
+ Layers & Boundaries
+ Interfaces
+ Abstract Classes
+ Concrete Classes
+ Entities
+ Use Case Layer
+ Domain Layer
+ Infra Layer

## **SOLID Principles**  //  [**Ref - www.freecodecamp.com**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solid-principles-explained-in-plain-english/)

+ **S** =>  The Single Responsibility Principle
+ **O** =>  The Open-Closed Principle
+ **L** =>  The Liskov Substitution Principle
+ **I** =>  The Interface Segregation Principle
+ **D** =>  The Dependency Inversion Principle  

## **The Single Responsibility Principle**  
  
The Single Responsibility Principle states that **a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.**  

**Trick**   


  + **If you ask yourself what your class does and the answer is something AND/OR oneother thing, chances are that the class doesnâ€™t adhere to the Single responsibility principle.**  

Robert C. Martin(Uncle Bob) says:

"Gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different reasons."  
So, itÂ´s nice to check if you are not disrespecting the Single Responsability Principle.

## The Open-Closed Principle  
  
The Open-Closed Principle requires that classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.

Modification means changing the code of an existing class, and extension means adding new functionality.

**Open for Extension:**  
  + adding new functionality(create or change methods ON INSTANCES/OBJECTS)   



**Closed for Modification:**
  +  changing the code of existing class(make changes ON CLASSES) 


The main question is...**how do we do it?!**

There are some **DESIGN PATTERS** that makes it possible to code respecting the **Open-Closed Principle.**

+ **Composite**    
+ **Decorator**  
+ **Proxy**  
+ **Strategy**  



Everything is chained on Clean Architecture.
You will use design patterns to achieve SOLID principles implementation while implements clean architecture.
ThatÂ´s why create a good quality code isnÂ´t easy.You must master all those concepts and learn how to implement them!

I will ve talking about the **Gang of Four** and their **22 Design Patterns** after SOLID principles.  


**IMPORTANT** 

Do not use inherance on your code. ThatÂ´s possible and IÂ´m sure some one told you that itÂ´s a bennefit from OOP.
You can extends the class and create new personalized objects, with polimorphism by changing also their behavier(methods) and implementing new ones.
Ok...**thatÂ´s not you should do from now on!**

>**What should I do?!**  
>
>If you need to extend a class, thatÂ´s fine. But you should not **extend** , but **implement** new classes. That means you should create an abstract class or you should create an interface to be implemented by those concrete classes that you need to create.
>ThatÂ´s important because youÂ´ll be also might be respecting the DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE from soli**D** if those classes are on a more external layer.
>Also, you will not be chaining the concrete classes together, and that independency is the objective.
>
>**Use interfaces insted of extend the parent class. Just create an interface, a contract with the parent class especifications and implements it.Leave the parent concrete class alone.Do not extend it.

## The Liskov Substitution Principle  

The better way to understand this principle is to realise that the children class is an EXTENSION of the parent class. So, it has some boundaries established for the parent.

Parameters +
Return - 

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

This principle is very dangerous, because itÂ´s hard to identify on code.

## The Interface Segregation Principle  

This principle tell us that we should create small interfaces that have only the methods that the concrete class that will be implementing it needs.

If you have a contract with one or more method that the class that will be implementing the interface will never use, you are just creating more complexity and increasing the chances of a software crash.

The inharence allows that a class have just one parent class. But any class can have multiple interfaces.
So, itÂ´s better create many interfaces. One to each one of your classes needs.

##  The Dependency Inversion Principle  

The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.  

This principle is respected by using interfaces. When you use an interface you invert the dependencie and inside layers wonÂ´t know outside layers.
