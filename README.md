## About This Repo

At this repo IÂ´ll be learning how to implement Clean Architecture on a node api project.\
Also, **my main objective isnÂ´t just to know how to do it, but also try to identify what DESIGN PATTERS are being used and which SOLID principle they are implementing to achieve Clean Architecture implamentation.** ðŸ¤“

The main resource of this activite is [**this live**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0gpCCA8ZPs&t=9s) that these brazilian giants devs have made. **Rodrigo Branas** and **Rodrigo Manguinhos**.

##  About Clean Architecture

["Uncle Bob" BLOG](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

"By separating the software into layers, and conforming to **The Dependency Rule**, you will create a system that is intrinsically **testable**, with all the benefits that implies. When any of the external parts of the system become obsolete, like the database, or the web framework, **you can replace** those **obsolete elements with a minimum of fuss**."

+ Layers & Boundaries
+ Interfaces
+ Abstract Classes
+ Concrete Classes
+ Entities
+ Use Case Layer
+ Domain Layer
