## About This Repo

At this repo IÂ´ll be learning how to implement Clean Architecture on a node api project.
Also, my main objective isnÂ´t just to know how to do it, but also try to identify what DESIGN PATTERS are being used and which SOLID principle they are implementing.

The main resource of this activite is [**this live**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0gpCCA8ZPs&t=9s) that those brazilian giants devs made, **Rodrigo Branas** and **Rodrigo Manguinhos**.
